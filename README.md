##### This project has been done for CSE 3200 ( Software Development Project II ) under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cse.ruet.ac.bd/mahitcse" target="_blank">Mahit Kumar Paul</a>, Assistant Professor, Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology.

##### Language: Python, MySQL
##### Editor  : Visual Studio Code
##### Algorithm for Face Detection: Haarcascade 
##### Algorithm for Face Recognition: Local Binary Pattern Historgram

### This project follows these steps-
#####  1. The necessary information of students were collected and saved in the database.
#####  2. The photo samples for registered students were taken and stored in local directory.
#####  3. The model was trained on those images.
#####  4. Now, when the face recognizer page is clicked, it opens a window for capturing image, draws a boundary box around the face of that image and identify the student's roll, name and department and marked that student as present in respective .csv file.
